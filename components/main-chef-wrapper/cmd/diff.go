		DisableFlagsInUseLine: true, // [options] is not helpful when appended to 'use' in this context
		Short:                 "Generate an itemized diff of two Policyfile lock documents",
		Long: `
Display an itemized diff comparing two revisions of a Policyfile lock.

When the '--git' option is given, '%s diff' either compares a given
git reference against the current lockfile revision on disk or compares
between two git references. Examples:

* '%s diff --git HEAD': compares the current lock with the latest
commit on the current branch.
* '%s diff --git master': compares the current lock with the latest
commit to master.
* '%s diff --git v1.0.0': compares the current lock with the revision
as of the 'v1.0.0' tag.
* '%s diff --git master...dev-branch': compares the Policyfile lock on
master with the revision on the 'dev-branch' branch.
* '%s diff --git v1.0.0...master': compares the Policyfile lock at the
'v1.0.0' tag with the lastest revision on the master branch.

'%s diff --head' is a shortcut for 'chef diff --git HEAD'.

When no git-specific flag is given, '%s diff' either compares the
current lockfile revision on disk to one on the %s or compares
two lockfiles on the %s. Lockfiles on the %s
are specified by Policy Group. Examples:

* '%s diff staging': compares the current lock with the one currently
assigned to the 'staging' Policy Group.
* '%s diff production...staging': compares the lock currently assigned
to the 'production' Policy Group to the lock currently assigned to the
'staging' Policy Group.
